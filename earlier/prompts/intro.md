I would like you to help me write a retrospective of the FOAF project. Online references are required. I would like you to begin with an informal introduction describing how the project started and what the initial goals were. I would then like discussion FOAF's role in early semantic web initiatives and its place on the early social web. This should be followed by the growth of the use of metadata in web pages at large and the use by google and others of that metadata and the schema.org project. Next, I would like to discuss the project's impact on the development of linked data and the status of linked data in the present day. I would then like you to discuss the project's legacy and its current relevance to the web and AI systems.
