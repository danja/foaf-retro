# FOAF Project Retrospective

_everything here is a placeholder_

I express my network in a FOAF file, and that is the start of the revolution.

## The Early Years

The "Friend of a Friend" (FOAF) project was started in 2000 by Dan Brickley and Libby Miller as an open, community-led initiative. The project's initial goal was to create a universal standard for describing people and the relationships between them. FOAF was introduced as a tool that would allow computers to read personal information on homepages in the same way that humans do. The FOAF vocabulary was designed to serve as a dictionary of terms that could be used to express claims about people, their interests, relationships, and activities.

## FOAF and the Early Semantic Web

The FOAF project was one of the early initiatives of the Semantic Web, aiming to create a machine-processable web of data. FOAF played a significant role in this effort by providing a way to express metadata about people and their connections. The use of FOAF vocabulary allowed for the creation of social networks and the investigation of early Semantic Web adoption.

## The Growth of Metadata

Around the time FOAF was introduced, the use of metadata in web pages was also growing rapidly. By 1998, 70% of public websites were using metadata, and search engines began to utilize this metadata to display in search results. However, search engines like Google were cautious about using metadata due to concerns over its trustworthiness and the potential for exploitation through SEO practices.

## Schema.org and Search Engines

In 2011, the world's biggest search engines at the time (Bing, Google, and Yahoo!) launched the schema.org initiative to standardize metadata vocabulary and create a common set of schemas for structured data markup on web pages. Schema.org provided a "lingua franca" for search engines to understand web content better and improve the user experience with richer search results.

## FOAF and Linked Data

FOAF played a significant role in the development of Linked Data, providing a way to create personal, machine-readable descriptions. This enabled the creation of Linked Data profiles and datasets, allowing developers to build rich web applications with relative ease. However, FOAF-based Linked Data also raised privacy concerns due to the potential for malicious usage of publicly available data.

## Legacy and Current Relevance

While FOAF predated popular social networking sites like Facebook, the issues it aimed to address, such as privacy and data ownership, remain relevant in the industry. FOAF demonstrated the feasibility of decentralized social networking, even if it never gained mainstream popularity. Today, FOAF continues to be relevant in the context of linked data and semantic web technologies, providing a valuable resource for scientific knowledge and outsourcing justification.
